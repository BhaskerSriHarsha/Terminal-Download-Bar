When we write C programs and print something to the screen, it usually appears in the next line.
But we often observe that when we are downloading software in Ubuntu terminal we can see "Download bars" and "Download Percentages" which keep on changing but remain in the same line.We also see "download wheels" that appear to be rotating

This code in DownloadBar.cpp demonstrates how we can show the "download bar" in terminal on the same line.

Code in DownloadPercentage.cpp demonstrates how we can show "download percentage" in terminal on the same line.

Code in rotating wheel demonstrates how the famous "\|-/" turning wheel effect is created.
