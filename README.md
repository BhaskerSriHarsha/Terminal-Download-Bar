Download-bar that appears when downloading packages in Ubuntu terminal

When we write C programs and print something to the screen, it usually appears in the next line.
But we often observe that when we are downloading software in Ubuntu terminal we can see "Download bars" which keep on changing
but remain in the same line.

This code demonstrates how it is done.
