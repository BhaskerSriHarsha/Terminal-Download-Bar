When we write C programs and print something to the screen, it usually appears in the next line.
But we often observe that when we are downloading software in Ubuntu terminal we can see "Download bars" and "Download Percentages" which keep on changing but remain in the same line.

This code in DownloadBar.cpp demonstrates how we can show the "download bar" in terminal on the same line.

Code in DownloadPercentage.cpp demonstrates how we can show "download percentage" in terminal on the same line.
